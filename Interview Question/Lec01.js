// Q. what is difference between Const and var;
Answer: var, let, and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript.
var is function-scoped, allows redeclaration, and can cause bugs, so it is generally avoided.
let is block-scoped and allows reassignment but not redeclaration.
const is also block-scoped and does not allow reassignment, making code more secure.
In modern JavaScript, we prefer const by default and use let only when the value needs to change.”

1️⃣ Role of JavaScript in Full Stack Development

Script:

“JavaScript plays a very important role in Full Stack Development because it is used on both the frontend and backend. On the frontend, JavaScript is used to create interactive user interfaces such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and user events. On the backend, JavaScript is used with Node.js to handle server logic, APIs, and database communication. Using JavaScript allows developers to build complete applications using a single programming language.”



2️⃣ What is Hoisting in JavaScript?

Script:

“Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before execution. Because of hoisting, we can access variables declared with var before initialization, but their value will be undefined. However, variables declared using let and const are hoisted but cannot be accessed before declaration.”

3️⃣ What are the Data Types in JavaScript?

Script:

“JavaScript has two main types of data types: primitive and non-primitive. Primitive data types include Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, and BigInt. Non-primitive data types include Object, Array, and Function. Primitive types store single values, while non-primitive types store collections of data.”

4️⃣ What is DOM and What Are the Accessing Methods?

Script:

“The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document as objects. It allows JavaScript to dynamically access and modify HTML elements, styles, and content. Common DOM accessing methods include getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll.”

5️⃣ What is an Arrow Function?

Script:

“An arrow function is a shorter and cleaner syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. It was introduced in ES6 and helps reduce boilerplate code. Arrow functions do not have their own this keyword, which makes them useful in callbacks and modern JavaScript applications.”

6️⃣ What Do You Understand by Object in JavaScript?

Script:

“In JavaScript, an object is a collection of data stored in the form of key-value pairs. Objects are used to represent real-world entities such as users, products, or students. Each object can contain properties and methods that define its behavior.”
